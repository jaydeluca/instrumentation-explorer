# Project Requirements: Instrumentation Explorer

## Current State (Completed Features):

*   **Project Scaffolding:** A React application initialized with Vite.
*   **Data Loading and Parsing:** A script successfully parses `instrumentation-list.yaml` into a JSON format (`instrumentation-list.json`) consumable by the frontend.
*   **Library List View:** Displays a list of all instrumentation libraries with their names and descriptions.
*   **Search and Filter Functionality:** Users can search and filter the library list by name.
*   **Library Detail View:** A dedicated page/component displays detailed information for a selected library, including all fields from the YAML data.
*   **Basic Styling and UX Improvements:** Initial CSS styling has been applied to improve the visual appeal, including card sizing, text, and basic alignment.
*   **UI Enhancement - Centering Container:** The main application container is now centered for improved visual balance.
*   **UI Enhancement - Configuration Data Display:** Configuration data in the Library Detail View is now presented using a table format.
*   **UI Enhancement - Telemetry Data Display:** A toggle mechanism has been implemented for displaying telemetry data based on the `when` condition, showing only one at a time.
*   **UI Enhancement - Consistent Card Sizing:** Standardized the height of library cards on the main page and truncated long descriptions to create a uniform and clean grid layout.
*   **UI Enhancement - Improved Telemetry View:** Enhanced the Telemetry Detail View by visually separating Metrics and Spans into distinct sections for better readability.
*   **UI Enhancement - Styled Telemetry Attributes:** Improved the styling of telemetry attributes by highlighting metric names and span kinds, and presenting attributes in a more structured and visually appealing format.
