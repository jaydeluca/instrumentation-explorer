# Gemini CLI Session Summary

## Project Overview

This project, "instrumentation-explorer," is a web-based tool designed to explore and display information about Java instrumentation libraries. The goal is to provide a clear, searchable, and filterable interface for understanding the capabilities of each library, including the telemetry data they generate (metrics and spans) and their adherence to semantic conventions.

## Current State

The application is in a good state. We have successfully:

*   Set up a React frontend using Vite.
*   Parsed the `instrumentation-list.yaml` file into a JSON format for the frontend.
*   Implemented a main view that displays a list of instrumentation libraries.
*   Added search and filtering capabilities to the main view.
*   Created a detailed view for each library.
*   Integrated semantic convention data from the OpenTelemetry GitHub repository to enrich the instrumentation data.
*   Highlighted semantic conventions in the UI.
*   Made significant styling and UX improvements, including a consistent layout, better data presentation, and a cleaner theme.
*   Added versioning to the instrumentation data, allowing users to switch between different versions of the libraries.
*   Implemented a telemetry version diff tool on the detail page to highlight differences in emitted telemetry between versions.

## Key Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
*   **Data:** YAML, JSON
*   **Styling:** CSS

## Next Steps

The next major feature is to deploy the application.
