  "description": "The executor instrumentation ensures that context is automatically propagated when using common Java executors (e.g., ThreadPoolExecutor, ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, ForkJoinPool). When a task is submitted, the current context is captured and bound to the task. Then, when the task eventually runs, even if itâ€™s on a different thread, the instrumentation reactivates that context, enabling consistent correlation across concurrent and asynchronous workflows.\n",
